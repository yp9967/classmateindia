## Usage

The frontend of this application allows volunteers to register by providing their details, including name, contact number, email, spoken languages, availability, and location. Volunteers can submit their information using the registration form.


## Application Flow

The application flow involves the following steps:


1. **Landing Page (Home Page):** The landing page is the home page of the application. It provides an option to "Get Started Today."

2. **Registration Form:** Clicking on "Get Started Today" redirects users to the registration form page.

3. **Volunteer Registration:** Volunteers fill out a registration form with their details.

4. **Data Submission:** After submitting the registration form, the data is sent to the backend server for processing and matching with suitable classrooms.

5. **Successful Registration Alert:** Upon successful registration, users receive an alert message confirming their registration.

6. **Allocation Presentation:** The registered volunteers are then presented to the Admin overseeing the volunteer program.

7. **Admin Page:** An admin page is available to staff members. The "Assign" button is displayed on the admin page after 20 successful volunteer registrations.
